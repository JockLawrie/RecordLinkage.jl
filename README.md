# SpineBasedRecordLinkage.jl

Spine-based record linkage in Julia.

## Concepts

- We start with 1 or more tabular data sets.

- Each record in each table describes either an entity or an event involving an entity.

- An __entity__ is the unit of interest. It is usually a person, but may be something else such as a business enterprise.

- A __event__ involving an entity may be a sale, a hospital admission, an arrest, a mortgage payment, and so on.
  In some contexts, such as healthcare, events are known as episodes or encounters.
  In others, such as sales, events are transactions.

- __Record linkage__ is, at its core, the problem of determining whether two records refer to the same entity.

- The 2 basic approaches to record linkage are:
  - __Cluster-based linkage__: Records from the various data sets are clustered according to their content.
  - __Spine-based linkage__:   Records are linked one at a time to a __spine__ - a table in which each record specifies an entity.

## Usage

This package provides 2 functions:

1. `construct_spine` is used to construct a spine from a given table.

2. `run_linkage` is used to link several tables to the spine.

Both operations are configured in YAML files and run as scripts, so that users needn't write any Julia code.

## Linkage

We describe the `run_linkage` function first because, while some of the underlying concepts used are also used in spine construction, they are more naturally introduced in the context of linkage.

### Configuration

Suppose you have a file called `linkage_config.yaml` which contains the following:

```yaml
projectname: myproject
output_directory:  "/path/to/linkage/output"
spine: {datafile: "/path/to/spine.tsv", schemafile: "/path/to/spine_schema.yaml"}
tables:
    table1: {datafile: "/path/to/table1.tsv", schemafile: "/path/to/table1_schema.yaml"}
    table2: {datafile: "/path/to/table2.tsv", schemafile: "/path/to/table2_schema.yaml"}
criteria:
    - {tablename: table1, exactmatch:  {firstname: First_Name, lastname: Last_Name, birthdate: DOB}}
    - {tablename: table1, exactmatch:  {birthdate: DOB},
                          approxmatch: [{datacolumn: firstname, spinecolumn: First_Name, distancemetric: levenshtein, threshold: 0.2},
                                        {datacolumn: lastname,  spinecolumn: Last_Name,  distancemetric: levenshtein, threshold: 0.2}]}
    - {tablename: table2, exactmatch:  {firstname: First_Name, middlename: Middle_Name, surname: Last_Name, birthdate: DOB}}
```

In this example we have:

- A project name and a directory that will contain the output. See the __Run Linkage__ section below for details on how these 2 fields are utilised.
- A pre-existing spine located at `/path/to/spine.tsv`.
  - See below for how to construct a spine if you don't already have one.
  - The spine is a _tab-separated values_ file, which indicated by the `tsv` extension.
  - A comma-separated values (`csv`) file would be fine too, provided that commas don't appear as values in any of the columns.
    Since commas are generally more common in data than tabs, a `tsv` is usually safer than a `csv`, though not foolproof.
- A schema of the spine specified in `/path/to/spine_schema.yaml`.
  This file specifies the columns, data types etc of the spine.
  See [Schemata.jl](https://github.com/JockLawrie/Schemata.jl) for examples of how to write a schema.
- Two tables, named `table1` and `table2`, to be linked to the spine.
  - The names are arbitrary.
  - The locations of each table's data file and schema file are specified in the same way as those of the spine. 
- A list of linkage criteria.
  - The list is processed in sequence, so that multiple sets of criteria can be compared to the same table in a specified order.
    For example, you can match on name and birth date, then on name and address.
  - Each element of the list is a set of criteria.
  - For each set of criteria:
    - The rows of the specified table are iterated over and the criteria are checked.
    - For a given row, if the criteria are satisifed then it is linked to a row of the spine.
  - In our example:
    - The 1st iteration will loop through the rows of `table1`.
      - A row is linked to a row in the spine if the values of `firstname`, `lastname` and `birthdate` in the row __exactly__ match the values of `First_Name`, `Last_Name` and `DOB` respectively in the spine row.
      - This scenario is equvialent to a SQL join, but does not require `table1` to fit into memory.
      - If the rows of `table1` specify events (instead of entities - see above), several rows in `table1` may link to a given spine row,
        though any given row can only link to 1 row in the spine.
    - The 2nd iteration requires an exact match for `birthdate` and approximate matches for `firstname` and `lastname`.
      Specifically, this iteration will match a row from `table1` to a row in the spine if:
      - The 2 rows match exactly on birth date.
      - The Levenshtein distance (see the notes below) between the first names in the 2 rows is no more than 0.2, and ditto for the last names.
    - The 3rd iteration iterates through the rows of `table2` and requires exact matches on first name, middle name, last name and birth date.

__Notes on approximate matches__

- Approximate matching relies on _edit distances_, which measure how different 2 strings are.
- In this package edit distances are scaled to be between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes an exact match (no difference) and 1 denotes complete difference.
- The distance between a missing value and another value (missing or not) is defined to be 1 (complete difference).
- The Levenshtein distance in our example is an example of an edit distance.
- For example:
  - `Levenshtein("robert", "robert") = 0`
  - `Levenshtein("robert", "rob") = 0.5`
  - `Levenshtein("robert", "bob") = 0.667`
  - `Levenshtein("rob",    "bob") = 0.333`
  - `Levenshtein("rob",    "tim") = 1`
  - `Levenshtein("rob",    missing) = 1`
- There are several edit distance measures available, see [StringDistances.jl](https://github.com/matthieugomez/StringDistances.jl) for other possibilities.
- If approximate matching criteria are specified and several rows in the spine satisfy the criteria for a given data row,
  then the best matching spine row is selected as the match for the data row.
- The best match is the spine row with the lowest total distance from the data row.

__Notes on exact matches__

- The notion of distance introduced above implies that a pair of values that match exactly have a distance between them of 0. For example, `Levenshtein(value1, value2) = 0`.
- Similalrly, a missing value cannot be part of an exact match because it has distance 1 from any other value. For example, `Levenshtein(value1, missing) = 1`.
- If no approximate matching criteria are specified then a record can only be linked to the spine if there is exactly 1 candidate match in the spine.

### Run linkage

Once you have a spine and your config is set up, you can run the linkage with the following code:

```julia
using SpineBasedRecordLinkage

run_linkage("/path/to/linkage_config.yaml")
```

Alternatively you can run the following script from the command line on Linux or Mac:

```bash
$ julia /path/to/SpineBasedRecordLinkage.jl/scripts/run_linkage.jl /path/to/linkage_config.yaml
```

Or using Windows PowerShell:

```bash
PS julia path\to\SpineBasedRecordLinkage.jl\scripts\run_linkage.jl path\to\linkage_config.yaml
```

When you run the above the following happens:

1. A new directory is created which will contain all output. Its name has the form: `{output_directory}/linkage-{projectname}-{timestamp}`
2. The directory contains `input` and `output` directories.
3. The `input` directory contains a copy of the config file and a file containing the versions of Julia and this package.
4. The output directory contins `identified` and `deidentified` directories.




## Constructing a spine

## Interrogating the results



## Tips for users

- The spine is currently required to fit into memory, though the tables to be linked to the spine can be arbitrarily large.
  For example, the package has been tested with files up to 60 million records.
- For performance this package only compares string values.
  Therefore it is important that data be formatted correctly before linkage, and before spine construction if you don't already have a spine.
  For example, dates should have a common format in all tables, invalid values should be removed, etc.
  Using the [Schemata.jl](https://github.com/JockLawrie/Schemata.jl) package is strongly recommended for this purpose,
  as it is easy to use and you can reuse the schema files for spine construction and linkage.
- When specifying the project name in the config, make it easily recognisable.
- For each data table, if a `last_updated` column exists, include it in the primary key.
- Governance (i.e., versioning) of the input tables is the responsibility of the user.
  - It is out of the scope of the linkage engine.
  - Users must ensure that the spine and data used in a linkage run is preserved without any changes. Otherwise the linkage run may not be reproducible.
